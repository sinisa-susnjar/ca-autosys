Introduction

  This file documents the changes to each and every release of the
  AutoSys perl API, going back as far as the initial 0.99 release.

Changes for 1.05 - release date 11-feb-2008

  o CA::AutoSys::Job:
    Variable substitutions are now only performed when the variable is set (bug 31726).
  o Added sample config for autorelay example.
  o Simplified select statement for job selection in CA::AutoSys::Job.
  o Improved output of autorep -q.

Changes for 1.04 - release date 29-oct-2007

  o Added status_time variable to CA::AutoSys::Status.
  o Added autorelay example.

Changes for 1.03 - release date 21-jun-2007

  o Replaced dependency DBD::Sybase with the more suitable DBI...
  o Added --dsn option to autorep and sendevent examples.
  o Added a small example web server for controlling AutoSys jobs.
  o Added -q option to autorep example.
  o Cleaned up the DBI mess (a little bit at least).
  o Moved the examples autorep and sendevent to bin directory.
  o Added a small example that shows howto control your AutoSys jobs
    via a web frontend.

Changes for 1.02 - release date 29-mar-2007

  o CA::AutoSys::Status:
    Method format_time() now returns localtime() instead of gmtime() (bug 24962).
    Added new instance variable "name" which contains the long name of the
    appropriate job's status, e.g. "SUCCESS".
  o CA::AutoSys:
    Method new() now accepts the option "dsn" with which one should be able to
    connect to AutoSys databases other than the default (Sybase).
    Note: I have not tested this feature with databases other than Sybase yet,
	since I currently only have access to a Sybase backed AutoSys installation.
	Any feedback is welcome!

Changes for 1.01 - release date 16-jan-2007

  o Added documentation / pods for *.pm files.
  o Added constants for states in CA::AutoSys::Status.

Changes for 1.00 - release date 15-jan-2007

  o Added online help (--help/--man) switches for examples.
  o Added missing META.yml (sorry, it's my first CPAN module...) 

Changes for 0.99 - release date 10-jan-2007

  o Initial development.
  o Implemented basic AutoSys features like job status querying, event sending.
