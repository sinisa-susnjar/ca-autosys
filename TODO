This is a short todo list for myself:

1) Make it more robust, add better error handling.

2) Add more features.

3) Add more documentation / examples.

4) Perform automatic sorting of displayed jobs in autorep based on start times,
   job dependencies, etc... (original autorep doesn't have that and I think
   it's a nifty feature...)

5) Improve performance of job / sub-job queries:

6) Add more automatic tests.

7) Implement "jil" ;-)

#
# First, we will get the jobs matching the given job name:
#
# select	j.job_name, j.joid, s.last_start, s.last_end, s.status, s.run_num, s.ntry
# from		job j join job_status s
# on		j.joid = s.joid
# where		j.job_name like 'CRISP%'
# order by j.joid;
#

#
# Then, we will feed the joids of the found jobs into the next select statement to
# get the child jobs. 
#
# select	j.job_name, j.joid, j.box_joid, s.last_start, s.last_end, s.status, s.run_num, s.ntry
# from		job j join job_status s
# on		j.joid = s.joid
# where		j.box_joid in (202091, 202093, 202095, 202097, 202099, 202101, 202103, 202105);
