BIG FAT NOTE

  This module is beta software!!!
  If you find a bug, please report it to me (the author), or if you made an
  improvement, please send the changes (in the form of a context diff) to me,
  so I can integrate it.
  If you would like a feature to be implemented in this module, drop me a line.

INTRODUCTION

  This module implements a perl5 API for accessing CA's AutoSys job control.

  For more information on the AutoSys product itself,
  see CA's website at: http://www3.ca.com/solutions/Product.aspx?ID=253

  This release requires perl5.005 or later, and some release of the AutoSys
  product installed, 4.5 or better should do just fine.

  This package has been known to build with the following combinations
  of software.  Those marked with an asterix (*) are platforms the
  author can not test personally, so there is a remote possibility that
  there may be new bugs in these platforms.  Please report problems to
  the author, of course.

    Operating System          AutoSys Version Perl Version FreeTDS Version
    ========================= =============== ============ ===============
    Cygwin 1.5.23 (WinXP SP2) 4.5             5.8.7        0.64
    openSUSE 10.3 (i586)      4.5             5.8.8        0.64

  NOTE: If you have built it on new platforms, *PLEASE* help save the free
  world by letting me know what version of AutoSys, OS, perl,
  etc. you built it with.

  If you succeed in making this work on any other platform, please send
  the changes (in the form of a context diff) to the author, so I can
  integrate it.

INSTALLATION

  This module installs much like anything else available on CPAN.
  Automatic tests are not yet provided.

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
	make test
    make install
                                                                     
  When using a Sybase backend, you may have to edit your $SYBASE/interfaces file or
  your $HOME/.freetds.conf file and add the appropriate AutoSys DB server(s).
