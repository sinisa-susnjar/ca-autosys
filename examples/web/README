This directory contains a little sample web server that can be used as a basis
for more elaborate ways to control your AutoSys jobs.

The web server makes extensive use of the excellent Perl modules HTML::Macro
and Net::HTTPServer. Those two modules are not mentioned in the dependency list
of CA::AutoSys for obvious reasons. Make sure you have them installed - otherwise
this example web server won't come up...

After starting the web server with the following command:

  ./httpd.pl --job=YOUR_JOB_PREFIX% --dsn=dbi:Sybase:server=YOUR_AUTOSYS_SERVER

you should see something like the following in your console window:

  2007/04/11 18:45:57 - Server running on port 8081

Now point your browser to http://localhost:8081 and enjoy ;-)

IMPORTANT NOTE: this is only an example implementation - a real web control
interface should of course also incooperate access control, proper logging and
better error handling, just to name a few... you get the point: don't use this
to run your production! You have been warned...
