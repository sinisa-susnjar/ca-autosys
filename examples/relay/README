This directory contains a little sample utility that can be used to relay events
from one AutoSys instance to another (e.g. from PROD to UAT).

It makes use of the excellent Perl module Config::IniFiles. This module is not
mentioned in the dependency list of CA::AutoSys for obvious reasons.
Make sure you have them installed - otherwise this example won't relay anything...

IMPORTANT NOTE: this is only an example implementation - if you intend to use
this to run your production, you're doing it on your own risk! You have been warned...
